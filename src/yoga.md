I've been practicing yoga for over 14 years and am a recent grad of [Black Swan Yoga's](https://www.blackswanyoga.com) 200hr Intensive program. As such I teach the Vinyasa style and focus on breath-based movement. In my practice, I promote proper form for any level of strength or flexibility and maintaining a level breath. Yoga is for everyone and encompasses more than just the physical practice. Any time you take a moment to breath and center yourself in your daily life is yoga!

Currently, I lead practice one Sunday a month at the [Festival Beach Food Forest](https://festivalbeach.org) at 11AM. The forest canopy provides shade and shelter and allows us to practice rain or shine!
