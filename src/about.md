Iâ€™m Justice a software engineer and yogi. I've created rich user-experiences on the front-end, built fullstack apps, and toyed with indie game development. When I'm not coding, I'm deepening my yoga practice. 

I've been a software engineer for around 7 years, specifically with 5 years of professional front-end experience. I've worked for companies of all sizes from startup to FAANG and industries like healthcare, construction, and ecommerce. If you're looking for a strong web dev take a look at my [LinkedIn](https://www.instagram.com/justicepwhite/) and connect with me!

I started my yoga journey over 10 years ago and in the summer of 2024 I had the priviledge of deepening my yoga practice with the 200 hour yoga teacher training led by [Black Swan Yoga](https://www.blackswanyoga.com).
